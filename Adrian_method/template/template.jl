  )

Run multiple rounds of clustering and complex construction, returning the result
with the smallest joining locus (i.e., the best fitness).

Each round, the trajectory is clustered into `k` clusters using ParallelKMeans,
and the resulting complex is evaluated by the length of its joining locus (edges
shared by 3 or more faces). The fitness function is the negative of the joining
locus length (so maximizing fitness minimizes the joining locus). The best
result across all rounds is returned.

Args:
- trajectory: Matrix where rows are time points and columns are dimensions.
- k: Number of clusters.

Keyword args:
- rounds::Int=10: Number of clustering rounds to try (each with a different
  k-means initialization).
- maxiter::Union{Int, Nothing}=nothing: Maximum iterations for k-means (passed
  to ParallelKMeans).
- connectivity_threshold::Int=30: Minimum number of transitions required for an
  edge between clusters.
- max_force_boundary::Int=0: Minimum cycle length to force as a 2-cell boundary
  (passed to faces()).
- print_frequencies::Bool=false: If true, print the frequencies of joining locus
  lengths across rounds.
- allow_empty_joining_locus::Bool=false: If false (default), results with joining locus length 0 are skipped and not considered as best. If true, such results are allowed.

Returns:
- A named tuple containing the best result, with fields:
    - clusters: Vector of (centroid, point_idxs) tuples.
    - assignments: Raw assignments vector from k-means.
    - centroids: Vector of centroid coordinates.
    - connectivity_matrix: Sparse matrix of cluster transitions.
    - edges: Vector of directed edges.
    - mcb: Minimal cycle basis (vector of cycles).
    - faces: Vector of 2-cell faces (unique cycles).
    - joining_locus: Vector of edges in the joining locus.
    - joining_locus_length: Number of edges in the joining locus.
    - round: The round in which the best result was found.

  cycle_is_2cell(cycle_vertices, edges)

Check if a cycle, given as a list of vertices, cannot be traversed consistently
using the provided directed edges.

A cycle `[v1, v2, ..., vn]` is considered a 2-cell depending on whether either
all directed edges `(v1, v2), (v2, v3), ..., (vn, v1)` exist, or all reversed
directed edges `(v2, v1), (v3, v2), ..., (v1, vn)` exist in the `edges` list.
This function returns true if NEITHER of these conditions holds.

Args:

  `FastMCB`).
- edges: A vector of tuples `(u, v)` representing the directed edges in the
  graph.

  in `cycle_vertices` is less than this value, the function will
